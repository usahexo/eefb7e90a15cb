<h1 id="First-Time-at-Hemingway-Casino-Play-Our-Blackjack-Game-First"><a href="#First-Time-at-Hemingway-Casino-Play-Our-Blackjack-Game-First" class="headerlink" title="First Time at Hemingway Casino? Play Our Blackjack Game First!"></a>First Time at Hemingway Casino? Play Our Blackjack Game First!</h1><p>Looking for a quality casino gaming experience the first time you visit Hemingway Casino? Look no further than our blackjack game! Blackjack is a classic casino game that is easy to learn, but offers plenty of opportunities to make strategic decisions that can impact your outcome.</p>
<p>Our blackjack game offers a realistic online gaming experience, complete with all the sights and sounds you would expect from playing at a physical casino. Whether you’re a seasoned blackjack player or new to the game, we have tips and tricks to help you play like a pro.</p>
<p>To start, let’s take a quick look at the basic rules of blackjack. In order to win, your final hand value must be higher than the dealer’s hand, but must not exceed 21. You are dealt two cards at the beginning of the game, and the dealer is also dealt two cards - one face up and one face down. In order to determine your hand value, add up the values of your cards - with Aces being worth 1 or 11 points, depending on what makes sense for your hand. Face cards are worth 10 points each, and all other cards are worth their number value.</p>
<p>If you would like to “hit” and receive another card, simply tell the dealer and he will give you another card. If you would like to “stand” (not receive any additional cards), tell the dealer “Stand” or tap the table in front of you. You can also choose to “double down” on your bet if you have a good hand - this means that you will receive just one more card, and then must stand. Finally, if you think that the dealer has a poor hand (17 or below), you can choose to “insure” your bet by placing an additional bet equal to half of your original bet. If the dealer then ends up with a blackjack (21), your insurance bet pays out 2-1 odds.</p>
<p>Now that we know some of the basic rules, let’s move on to some tips for how best to play blackjack! First and foremost: never split Aces! This may seem like common sense, but many players make this mistake and wind up giving away free money unnecessarily. Another tip is to always stand if your hand is 17 or higher - since hitting again could put you over 21 and lose the game automatically.</p>
<p>If you’re feeling lucky, consider doubling down on hands totaling 9, 10 or 11 points. This increases your chances of winning by giving yourself one more chance to get closer to 21 without going over. However, be aware that doubling down comes with increased risk - so only do it if you feel confident in your hand!</p>
<p>As with any casino game, practice makes perfect! Play our free blackjack game today and see how well you can do when pitted against the dealer. With enough practice, eventually you’ll be able to beat the house edge and walk away with some extra cash in your pocket!</p>
