            <h1 id="What-is-the-objective-of-the-game"><a href="#What-is-the-objective-of-the-game" class="headerlink" title="What is the objective of the game?"></a>What is the objective of the game?</h1><p>The objective of the game is to be the last player or team standing. Players must eliminate each other by shooting them with a gun until only one player is left. The game is over when there is only one player or team left.</p>
<h1 id="What-kind-of-animals-can-be-found-in-the-game"><a href="#What-kind-of-animals-can-be-found-in-the-game" class="headerlink" title="What kind of animals can be found in the game?"></a>What kind of animals can be found in the game?</h1><p>The game has a variety of animals that can be found on the game, which includes lions, tigers, elephants, and more. Players will have to be careful when travelling around the game as they may encounter these animals. Some of the animals that can be found in the game are dangerous, so it is important for players to be aware of their surroundings at all times.</p>
<h1 id="What-buttons-do-I-need-to-use-to-play-the-game"><a href="#What-buttons-do-I-need-to-use-to-play-the-game" class="headerlink" title="What buttons do I need to use to play the game?"></a>What buttons do I need to use to play the game?</h1><p>There are many buttons that can be used to play games, but certain buttons will work better for some games than others. </p>
<p>First and foremost, controllers are a must for most games. There are many different types of controllers available on the market, such as Playstation 4 controllers, Xbox One controllers, or Nintendo Switch Joy-Con controllers. Be sure to check the type of controller needed for the game you want to play before making a purchase. </p>
<p>Next, consider what kind of games you want to play. If you are interested in first person shooters such as Halo or Call of Duty, then an Xbox One or Playstation 4 is necessary. If you’re into racing games, then a Nintendo Switch or an Xbox One might be a better option due to their racing wheel peripherals that are available on the market. </p>
<p>No matter what console you decide to buy, there are some essential buttons that all gamers should know about. On Playstation 4’s Dualshock 4 controller, the following buttons are essential: X button, Circle button, Square button, Triangle button, L1 button, R1 button, Options button (also known as the Start button), and Share button. The X button is used to jump or interact with objects; the Circle button is used to crouch or pick up items; the Square button is used as a weapon trigger or to reload ammo; the Triangle Button is used as a contextual action (such as opening doors); and the L1 and R1 buttons are used for weapon targeting and grenades&#x2F;explosives respectively. Finally, the Options and Share buttons are used for pausing and taking screenshots&#x2F;recordings respectively. </p>
<p>On an Xbox One controller, these same buttons perform similar functions with a few exceptions. The Y button replaces the Circle button as the interact function; B replaces X as the jump&#x2F;attack function; View replaces Options as the menu selector; and Menu replaces Start as the pause function. The left joystick moves your character around while the right joystick adjusts your camera angle. Lastly, RB replaces L1 as your grenade&#x2F;weapon target and LB replaces R1 as your melee attack control. </p>
<p>Nintendo Switch Joy-Con controllers feature even more buttons than other gaming controllers! In addition to standard movement controls on each joystick (L Joy-Con &#x3D; Left Joystick &#x2F; R Joy-Con &#x3D; Right Joystick), there are also ZL and ZR buttons on the left Joy-Con and SL and SR buttons on the right Joy-Con which can be used in various ways depending on which game you’re playing. For instance, in Super Mario Party board game mode, players use ZL + A or ZL + B to roll dice instead of using typical D-pad controls. Similarly, in Splatoon 2’s single player Octo Canyon mode players use SL + Y (or SR + B) to fire ink rockets instead of using A or B to swim around quickly in squid form underwater. Be sure to check out your favorite games’ instruction manuals or look online for gameplay videos so that you can familiarize yourself with all of the different controls available!</p>
<h1 id="What-awards-can-be-won-during-the-game"><a href="#What-awards-can-be-won-during-the-game" class="headerlink" title="What awards can be won during the game?"></a>What awards can be won during the game?</h1><p>There are different types of awards that a player can win during the game. The main types of awards are jackpots, bonuses, and progressive jackpots.</p>
<p>A Jackpot is an award that is given to a player who has collected all of the symbols that are associated with that particular jackpot. There are different types of jackpots, which include regular, mega, and super jackpots.</p>
<p>A Bonus is an award that is given to a player who has completed a certain task or made a certain combination of symbols. Some bonuses include free spins, bonus rounds, and cash prizes.</p>
<p>A Progressive Jackpot is an award that increases in size as more players participate in the game. The size of the progressive jackpot will continue to increase until it is won by someone.</p>
<h1 id="Where-can-I-find-more-information-about-the-game"><a href="#Where-can-I-find-more-information-about-the-game" class="headerlink" title="Where can I find more information about the game?"></a>Where can I find more information about the game?</h1><p>There are a few great resources available for people looking to learn more about the game. The first is the game’s website, which has a wealth of information about the game, including playing tips and how to download it.</p>
<p>The second is YouTube. A simple search for “Angry Birds Stella” brings up a variety of helpful videos. Some are walkthroughs that show players how to complete each level, while others are comedic takes on the game.</p>
<p>Finally, there are several fan sites that offer additional information and insights into the game. One such site is AngryBirdsNest.com, which has a forum where players can share tips and strategies, as well as view leaderboard rankings for each level.</p>
