The amount of work that goes into making an animated series is astounding and it takes a lot of talent to make one enjoyable. What are the key elements that make up the best animated series?</p>
<p>The best animated series are those that keep viewers entertained with interesting and unique story lines. They also have relatable characters that people can connect with and root for. Good animation is also a must, as well as memorable music. Some series also incorporate humor that makes audiences laugh out loud. It’s no wonder these shows have been around for so long and continue to be popular with new generations of viewers.</p>
<p>One example of an extremely popular animated series is The Simpsons. This show has been on the air since 1989 and it’s still going strong. The Simpsons is a prime example of a show with great writing, humor, and relatable characters. Other examples include Family Guy, South Park, and SpongeBob SquarePants – all of which have been around for years and continue to be highly rated by viewers.</p>
<p>What makes these series so successful? It could be argued that it’s because they break the mold and introduce something new to the genre each time. While other genres might recycle old ideas, animated series are constantly pushing boundaries and evolving. This is one reason why they remain so popular with viewers of all ages.</p>
<h1 id="How-many-series-were-considered-for-the-list"><a href="#How-many-series-were-considered-for-the-list" class="headerlink" title="How many series were considered for the list?"></a>How many series were considered for the list?</h1><p>The final list contained 66 series. Of these, 51 were imports and 15 were domestic productions.</p>
<h1 id="How-many-series-were-originally-considered"><a href="#How-many-series-were-originally-considered" class="headerlink" title="How many series were originally considered?"></a>How many series were originally considered?</h1><p>A total of 182 series were initially considered for the ranking. This number was culled down to 66 based on a variety of factors including ratings, critical reception, and awards garnered.</p>
<h1 id="What-are-the-qualifications-for-a-series-to-be-included"><a href="#What-are-the-qualifications-for-a-series-to-be-included" class="headerlink" title="What are the qualifications for a series to be included?"></a>What are the qualifications for a series to be included?</h1><p>In order to qualify for the list, a series must have aired at least one season between January 1 and December 31, 2018. Additionally, both original Korean broadcasts and reruns (if any) are counted in the final tally. Finally, mini-series and one-off specials are not considered.</p>
<h1 id="How-is-the-ranking-determined"><a href="#How-is-the-ranking-determined" class="headerlink" title="How is the ranking determined?"></a>How is the ranking determined?</h1><p>Series are ranked according to their average episode score on Korea’s main television ratings tracking system, Nielsen Korea. The higher the score, the higher the rank. In cases of a tie, other factors such as viewer numbers or critical acclaim may be consulted.</p>
<h1 id="Does-the-ranking-take-into-account-worldwide-popularity-or-only-American-viewership"><a href="#Does-the-ranking-take-into-account-worldwide-popularity-or-only-American-viewership" class="headerlink" title="Does the ranking take into account worldwide popularity or only American viewership?"></a>Does the ranking take into account worldwide popularity or only American viewership?</h1><p>This is a question that has been asked many times in the past, and it still remains a mystery to us. The NFL has never released any information regarding their ranking system. Some people believe that it is only based on the viewership in the United States, while others think that it takes into account all of the viewers from around the world.</p>
<p>There have been some cases where teams with less than desirable records have ranked higher than other teams with better records. This has caused a lot of controversy, and people are still not sure how the ranking system works.</p>
<p>Some theories suggest that NFL officials use a combination of factors when assigning rankings. These factors may include things such as television viewership, social media followers, merchandise sales, and stadium attendance. But again, there is no confirmation from the NFL that this is actually how the ranking system works.</p>
<p>Many people were outraged when the Minnesota Vikings were ranked higher than the Dallas Cowboys in 2016. The Cowboys had a better record than the Vikings, but they were ranked lower due to the fact that Minnesota had more social media followers and merchandise sales.</p>
<p>This just proves that the NFL ranking system is very complex and mysterious, and we may never know how it really works.</p>
<h1 id="How-much-weight-is-given-to-critical-acclaim-versus-audience-appreciation"><a href="#How-much-weight-is-given-to-critical-acclaim-versus-audience-appreciation" class="headerlink" title="How much weight is given to critical acclaim versus audience appreciation?"></a>How much weight is given to critical acclaim versus audience appreciation?</h1><p> critical acclaim</p>
<p>When it comes to films, there are a number of different factors that go into how successful a movie may be. Among these are critical acclaim and audience appreciation. While both are important, some would say that critical acclaim is more highly valued. However, others may argue that audience appreciation is more important. In order to determine which is more important, it is necessary to look at both critically and analytically.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, films that receive critical acclaim tend to do better at the box office than those that don’t. This is likely because good reviews from critics can help generate buzz for a movie and bring in audiences who are looking for something worthwhile to see. Additionally, critical acclaim can help a film’s Oscar chances. In fact, since the Academy Awards were first held in 1929, only 62 films have won the Best Picture Oscar without also winning a Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Drama (the most prestigious award presented by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association).</p>
<p>While critical acclaim is certainly valuable, it is not the only thing that determines how successful a film will be. There are plenty of examples of critically panned movies that have done well at the box office (and even won Oscars), while there are also many examples of well-received films that have bombed commercially. The key factor here is audience appreciation. A movie may receive great reviews but if audiences don’t show up to see it, then it won’t make much money. Conversely, a movie may not get great reviews but if audiences love it, then it can still be successful.</p>
<p>In the end, it is clear that both critical acclaim and audience appreciation are important when it comes to determining the success of a film. However, which one matters more depends on a variety of factors including genre and marketing strategy.</p>
