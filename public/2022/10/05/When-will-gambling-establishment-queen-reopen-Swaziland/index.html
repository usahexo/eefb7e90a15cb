            <h1 id="When-will-gambling-establishment-queen-reopen-Swaziland"><a href="#When-will-gambling-establishment-queen-reopen-Swaziland" class="headerlink" title="When will gambling establishment queen reopen Swaziland?"></a>When will gambling establishment queen reopen Swaziland?</h1><p>The gambling establishment queen of Swaziland, so named for its extravagance and apparently unequalled in Africa, has long been closed to the public. There is much speculation about when it will reopen, but no definitive answer as of yet.</p>
<p>Some reports say that the renovations are almost complete and it may reopen as soon as early 2019. Others say that the process is taking longer than expected and that a 2020 reopening is more likely. Still others claim that there are financial difficulties with the project that could push back the reopening indefinitely.</p>
<p>What is known for certain is that the estimated cost of refurbishing the queen has ballooned from $20 million to more than $50 million. This massive price tag has some people questioning whether it’s worth it to refurbish an establishment that may not even be profitable in the first place.</p>
<p>Some argue that the queen should stay closed until a business model can be put in place that ensures profitability. Others believe that it should be reopened as a tourist destination, providing jobs and economic stimulus to a country whose economy is struggling.</p>
<p>No matter what happens, one thing is clear: the gambling casino queen of Swaziland is a hot topic of conversation and everyone has an opinion about what should happen next.</p>
<h1 id="What-are-the-allegations-against-the-gambling-establishment-queen"><a href="#What-are-the-allegations-against-the-gambling-establishment-queen" class="headerlink" title="What are the allegations against the gambling establishment queen?"></a>What are the allegations against the gambling establishment queen?</h1><p>For more than a decade, the gambling establishment queen has been at the center of numerous allegations of wrongdoing. significantly, while these claims have never been proven in court, they paint a damning picture of enterprise practices that could easily be considered criminal.</p>
<p>Among the most serious accusations are that the gambling establishment queen cheated her customers by altering the odds of games in her favor. Additionally, there have been claims that she has refused to pay out winnings owed to players, and even resorted to intimidation and violence in order to keep them quiet.</p>
<p>Perhaps most concerning of all is the fact that these activities may have been carried out with the knowledge and tacit approval of government officials. This would suggest a level of corruption within the highest ranks of society which is truly alarming.</p>
<p>If true, it is clear that the gambling establishment queen represents a clear and present danger to society as a whole. Her influence must be curtailed before she can do any more damage.</p>
<h1 id="Is-the-gambling-establishment-queen-facing-any-charges"><a href="#Is-the-gambling-establishment-queen-facing-any-charges" class="headerlink" title="Is the gambling establishment queen facing any charges?"></a>Is the gambling establishment queen facing any charges?</h1><p>A few weeks ago, authorities in New Jersey launched a criminal probe into whether or not casino mogul and RNC finance chair Steve Wynn sexually harassed female employees. The investigation is still ongoing, but sources close to the case say that prosecutors are eyeing a possible sexual assault charge against Wynn.</p>
<p>This news comes as a surprise to many, as Wynn has been a long-time supporter of the Republican Party and has been heavily involved in presidential campaigns. He is also known for his lavish lifestyle and has been called the “gambling establishment queen.”</p>
<p>The allegations against Wynn first surfaced earlier this year when The Wall Street Journal published a report in which dozens of employees claimed that Wynn had harassed or assaulted them over the course of his career. Many of these employees said that they were afraid to speak up because Wynn was so powerful.</p>
<p>Wynn has denied all of the allegations against him, but he stepped down from his position as finance chair of the RNC shortly after they surfaced. He also sold all of his shares in Wynn Resorts Ltd., the company he founded.</p>
<p>So far, no charges have been filed against Wynn, but the investigation is still ongoing. If he is found guilty of sexual assault, he could face up to five years in prison.</p>
<h1 id="What-is-the-status-of-the-gambling-establishment-queen’s-case"><a href="#What-is-the-status-of-the-gambling-establishment-queen’s-case" class="headerlink" title="What is the status of the gambling establishment queen’s case?"></a>What is the status of the gambling establishment queen’s case?</h1><p>The status of the gambling establishment queen’s case is currently unknown. There have been no updates on her case since early November, when she was charged with money laundering and promoting gambling. It is unclear if she has made any progress in her case or not.</p>
<h1 id="When-will-the-gambling-establishment-queen-be-able-to-reopen-Swaziland"><a href="#When-will-the-gambling-establishment-queen-be-able-to-reopen-Swaziland" class="headerlink" title="When will the gambling establishment queen be able to reopen Swaziland?"></a>When will the gambling establishment queen be able to reopen Swaziland?</h1><p>The gambling establishment queen, who has asked not to be named, is anxiously waiting to learn when she will be able to reopen Swaziland’s only gambling establishment. The queen, who is also the majority owner of the casino, says she has been told by government officials that they are still in the process of studying the impact of the casino on the country.</p>
<p>“It’s been nearly two years since we were forced to close and I just want to know when we can reopen,” she said. “I have faith that the government will make the right decision and allow us to reopen soon.”</p>
<p>The closure of the casino, which is located in Mbabane, came as a shock to many in Swaziland. At the time, government officials said they were shutting it down because it was having a negative impact on the country’s economy. They also said they were concerned about its effect on tourism.</p>
<p>But many people believe that the real reason for the closure was political. The queen is alleged to have close ties to former Prime Minister Sibusiso Dlamini, who was removed from office in 2013 amid allegations of corruption. Dlamini has denied any wrongdoing.</p>
<p>There has been speculation that the closure of the casino was an attempt by current Prime Minister Barnabas Sibusiso Dlamini to distance himself from his predecessor. But Barnabas Sibusiso Dlamini has denied any involvement in the closure of the casino.</p>
<p>“I am not sure why it was closed but I am not involved in that decision,” he said recently. “I am just interested in making sure that it is reopened as soon as possible.”</p>
<p>While there is no clear answer as to why the casino was closed, most people agree that it should be reopened as soon as possible. The queen says she has already lost millions of dollars since it closed and many jobs have been lost. And Swaziland could certainly use the jobs and revenue that the casino would bring in.</p>
