#  Arizonans to vote on legalizing online gambling in November

Arizonans will vote in November on a ballot measure to legalize online gambling, the Associated Press reported Thursday.

The Arizona Secretary of State’s office confirmed that the initiative had qualified for the state’s general election ballot.

The proposed measure would allow people 21 and over to bet on poker, blackjack, slots and other games online. It would also permit racetracks and casinos to offer gambling services over the internet.

The initiative’s supporters turned in more than 220,000 signatures in support of the measure, far exceeding the 150,642 required to qualify for the ballot.

Opponents of the measure argue that it could lead to gambling addiction and other social problems. Supporters say that it would create jobs and generate revenue for the state.

This is not the first time that Arizonans will have voted on legalizing online gambling. A similar measure was defeated by a margin of just 2 percent in 2016.

#  Arizona edges closer to legalizing online gambling

Arizona lawmakers are pushing for a bill that would legalize online gambling in the state, as lawmakers see the potential for increased tax revenue.

“We’re looking at it because other states have done it and found it to be a viable way to increase revenue without adversely affecting the citizens of the state,” said Senator Sonny Borrelli (R-Lake Havasu City), one of the authors of the proposed legislation.

The move towards legalization is part of a larger trend across the US, where a growing number of states are moving to legalize some form of online gambling. So far, 11 states have legalized some form of online gambling, including poker.

The proposed Arizona bill would allow residents to gamble on casino games, poker, and sports betting through approved websites and apps. The bill would also impose a 13% tax on gaming revenue, which is expected to generate an additional $24 million per year in tax revenue.

Opponents of the bill argue that it could lead to problem gambling, but supporters say that there are already safeguards in place to protect consumers.

“We have strict rules and regulations for casinos here in Arizona and I think that would carry over to online gambling as well,” said Representative T.J. Shope (R-Coolidge). “There would be age restrictions and other rules in place to make sure people aren’t getting into trouble.”

The proposed Arizona bill still has a long way to go before becoming law, but with increasing pressure from state lawmakers to legalize online gambling, it is likely only a matter of time until the first US state legalizes it.

#  Bill seeking to legalize online gaming in Arizona progresses through legislature

On Monday, February 12th, Arizona State Senator Sonny Borrelli introduced a bill seeking to legalize and regulate online gaming in the state. The proposed legislation, SB 1065, is currently being reviewed by the Arizona Senate Committee on Gaming and Liquor.

If passed, SB 1065 would allow for licensed and regulated online gambling operators to offer their services to players located within Arizona’s borders. This would include a broad range of games such as poker, blackjack and slots. Revenue generated from online gaming would be directed towards schools and other important state programs.

Arizona is not the only state considering legalizing online gaming this year. In January, New Jersey lawmakers introduced a similar bill that is currently being debated in the state Senate. If passed, it would make New Jersey the second US state (after Nevada) to offer regulated online gambling.

For years now, supporters of legalized online gaming have argued that it would provide significant economic benefits to states and generate much-needed revenue for important public programs. And while it remains to be seen whether or not SB 1065 will pass in Arizona, it seems likely that we will see more states move towards legalizing online gaming in the coming months and years.

#  Arizona moves one step closer to legalizing online gambling

The Arizona House has unanimously passed a bill that would legalize and regulate online gambling within the state. The bill now moves to the Senate for further consideration.

If passed, the bill would authorize the Arizona Department of Gaming to regulate and license all forms of online gambling, including poker, casino games, and sports betting. Operators would be required to obtain a license from the department and pay an annual fee.

Gambling companies will no doubt be watching the progress of this bill closely, as it could provide a new market for their products. The American Gambling Association has voiced its support for the bill, stating that it will protect consumers and help to combat illegal gambling.

Opponents of the bill argue that it will lead to increased gambling addiction rates and other social problems. They also claim that it is unconstitutional because it violates the federal law prohibiting online gambling.

Arizona is not the only state considering legalizing online gambling. Earlier this year, New Jersey became the first state to allow online casinos, and several other states are exploring similar proposals.

#  Arizona lawmakers consider bill to legalize online gaming

On Monday, the Arizona Senate passed a bill that would legalize online gaming in the state. The measure, which was approved by a vote of 21-8, now moves to the House for further consideration.

The bill, SB1510, was sponsored by Republican Sen. Sonny Borrelli and would allow residents of Arizona to play poker and other casino games online. Players would be able to make bets with licensed and regulated entities located in other states.

Supporters of the bill argue that it would help generate new revenue for the state and create jobs. They also say that it would give Arizonans access to safe and secure gambling sites.

Opponents of the bill argue that it could lead to addiction and social ills. They also maintain that it would be difficult to enforce and could result in lost tax revenue for the state.

The House is expected to take up the measure in the coming weeks.
