#  What is the relationship between them?

The relationship between markdown and HTML is very close. In fact, they are practically the same language. HTML is a more complex and complete language that can be used to create entire websites. Markdown is a simpler and less powerful language that is designed for creating documents and articles.

Markdown was created because it is much easier to write in than HTML. When you write in markdown, you don't need to worry about tags or code. Everything is written in plain text, which makes it easy to read and understand. When you convert a markdown document to HTML, the converter will automatically add all of the necessary HTML tags.

There are many different markdown converters available, both online and offline. The most popular online converter is called MarkdownPad. There are also several desktop applications that can be used to convert markdown documents into HTML.

#  Does anyone know more about them?

The DAO is a decentralized autonomous organization, and a form of investor-directed management. The DAO was first proposed by Vitalk Buterin in early 2014. Development began in December 2015. It was launched on the Ethereum blockchain on 28 April 2016.

Through the use of smart contracts, the DAO is able to operate autonomously without a central authority. Funds were transferred into The DAO's Ether account and anyone could submit proposals for how to spend them. Voting rights were proportional to the number of tokens held by each participant.

On 17 June 2016, The DAO was hacked due to an exploit in its contract code. A total of 3,641,694 ether (approximately US$50 million at the time) was taken from The DAO's coffers and moved to a separate account where it remains as of September 2017. This led to a split in the Ethereum community with some supporting the fork while others opposed it arguing for whole blockchain immutability
