Double Bonus Poker is a casino game that offers excitement and thrills for players of all levels of experience. The basic premise of the game is to draw from a 52-card deck and make the best possible hand using any combination of your four cards and the five community cards.

The goal of Double Bonus Poker is to beat the dealer’s hand, without going over 21. Winning hands pay out at different rates, with the highest payout coming for a natural royal flush. In addition to the standard Jacks or Better payout table, Double Bonus Poker also offers a bonus payout for four aces, as well as double bonuses for four 2s, 3s, 4s, or 5s. Play begins by placing your bet and receiving five cards face-up. You then have the opportunity to either hold all five cards, or discard any number of them in favor of new cards from the deck. After discarding, you are dealt another card for each card you discarded. The dealer then flips over their first three community cards, followed by another card for their fourth (and final) card. If your hand is better than the dealer’s, you win!
