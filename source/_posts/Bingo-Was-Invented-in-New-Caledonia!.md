#  A Fun Game That Originated in New Caledonia!

Bocce is one of the oldest forms of lawn bowling and may have originated in Caledonia, which is an ancient name for the Scottish Highlands. Some historians believe that bocce was brought to America by Italians who immigrated to this country in the early 20th century. In any case, this enjoyable game can now be enjoyed by people all over the globe!

There are many variations of bocce, but the basic premise is always the same: players toss balls towards a target ball (or jack). The player or team that gets their balls closest to the jack wins the point(s). The first player or team to score a set number of points (usually 11) wins the match.

Bocce can be enjoyed by people of all ages and skill levels. It’s a great way to get some exercise, while also having some fun with friends and family. If you’ve never played bocce before, don’t worry – it’s easy to learn! Here are a few tips to help you get started:

1. Choose your footwear carefully. Bocce is often played on grassy surfaces, so it’s important to wear shoes that won’t damage the lawn. Tennis shoes or sneakers are ideal for this sport.

2. Try different throwing techniques. There are many ways to throw a bocce ball, so experimentation is key! You may want to try different stances and arm positions until you find one that works best for you.

3. Take your time when aiming. Bocce balls can take quite a while to reach their destination, so it’s important to take your time when aiming them. Make sure you have a clear path to the target ball and don’t rush your shots.
