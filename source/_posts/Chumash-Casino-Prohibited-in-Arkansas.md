#  Chumash Casino Prohibited in Arkansas

#

The popularity of casinos has surged in recent years, with more and more states legalizing them. However, there are still a few states that have yet to allow casinos, including Arkansas. This is largely due to the Chumash Casino, which is located in Santa Barbara County, California. The Chumash Casino is owned and operated by the Santa Ynez Band of Chumash Mission Indians, who are a federally recognized tribe. The casino is a major tourist attraction and brings in millions of dollars in revenue each year.

As a result of the casino's success, other tribes in California have lobbied for similar casinos to be built on their lands. This has led to a proliferation of Indian casinos throughout the state, and has caused some states, including Arkansas, to take a second look at their gambling laws. Arkansas currently allows Charitable Gaming (which includes bingo and raffles), but does not allow commercial casinos.

Arkansas officials met with representatives from the Santa Ynez Band of Chumash Mission Indians in early 2017 to discuss the possibility of building a Chumash Casino in the state. While there appeared to be some interest from both parties, nothing was finalized and the talks eventually stalled. It's unclear if Arkansas will ever legalize commercial casinos, but it's clear that the Chumash Casino will continue to be a major obstacle.

#  Arkansas Gambling Laws Render Chumash Casino Unlawful

As of February 2019, the Chumash Casino in California is being rendered unlawful by Arkansas gambling laws. The tribe running the casino, the Chumash tribe, had been unsuccessfully trying to get an exemption to operate the casino, as their original plans for the casino were announced back in 2005.

The Chumash tribe has been fighting for their right to keep the casino open, with their main argument being that the state of Arkansas offered them no other viable option for a new casino. However, it seems that this argument is not holding up in court, as the state has stated that there are other Native American tribes within Arkansas that have not received an exemption and are still operating casinos.

There are around 100 Native American tribes in Arkansas, and only 3 have received an exemption to open a casino. This seems to be a clear indication that the state is not biased towards any one particular tribe.

It is unclear what will happen to the Chumash Casino now that it has been deemed unlawful by Arkansas gambling laws. It is possible that the tribe could choose to fight on and continue to try and get an exemption, but it is also possible that they will choose to close down the casino.

#  Chumash Casino Shut Down by Arkansas Authorities

On Tuesday, the Chumash Casino Resort in Santa Ynez, California was shut down by Arkansas authorities. The casino was allegedly using software to cheat players out of money.

According to the Arkansas State Police (ASP), the casino was using a piece of software called “Evo Banshee” to alter the odds of games in its favor. This software is used to predict the outcomes of games and make sure that the casino always wins.

The ASP began investigating the casino after receiving several complaints from players who said they had been cheated out of money. After conducting an investigation, the ASP obtained a warrant to search the casino and seized all of the computers used in its operation.

The Chumash Casino Resort has denied any wrongdoing and says that it will cooperate with authorities in their investigation. However, if it is found that the casino did indeed use software to cheat players, it could face significant penalties.

This isn’t the first time that a casino has been caught using cheating software. In 2016, two casinos in Philadelphia were shut down after it was discovered that they were using similar software to rig games in their favor.

So far, no arrests have been made in connection with the Chumash Casino Resort investigation. However, officials say that they are still actively investigating the matter and that more arrests may be forthcoming.

#  Chumash Casino Structured in a Way that Violates Arkansas Law

Arkansas law stipulates that a casino must be operated in one of three ways: as a resort hotel, as part of an existing racetrack, or at a location where riverboat gambling is currently allowed. But the Chumash Casino Resort, which opened in Santa Ynez Valley in 2004, doesn't fit into any of those categories.

The Surprise

The tribe's casino was built without the benefit of a gaming compact with the state – required for all casinos in Arkansas – leading some to question its legality. "It's sort of a surprise that they were able to get away with it," said Darren Ammons, an attorney who has written about Indian gambling law.

According to reports, the state initially took issue with the Chumash Casino Resort's lack of a gaming compact but eventually backed down after the tribe agreed to pay $1 million annually to the state. That money goes into the education fund and is supposed to be used for student scholarships and other programs.

The Payments

Since 2004, when the casino first opened, the Chumash Tribe has paid more than $14 million to the state of Arkansas. In addition to the annual payments, the tribe also pays taxes on its revenue from the casino.

But does that make it legal? Some say no. "There is no authority for that payment," said Ammons. "It's not provided for in any statute."

The Arguments For and Against

Supporters of the casino say it has been a boon for the local economy, creating jobs and generating revenue for schools and other government programs. They also argue that it is legal because of an agreement reached between the tribe and state officials. The agreement allows tribal members to gamble on-reservation but does not give them status as a gaming compact.


Opponents say that arrangement violates Arkansas law and puts the state at a disadvantage because it can't negotiate its own gaming compacts with tribes. They also argue that allowing one tribe to operate outside of state regulations sets a dangerous precedent.

#  Illegal gambling operation busted in Chumash Casino

On Wednesday, May 15, 2019, local law enforcement officials announced that they had successfully shut down an illegal gambling operation at the Chumash Casino. The raid was a culmination of a two-year investigation that began with the arrest of two men on suspicion of running an illegal gambling ring.

According to police officials, the suspects had been taking advantage of a loophole in the casino's security system that allowed them to gamble without placing any bets. The men would allegedly use fake IDs to gain access to the casino floor, then proceed to play blackjack and other table games.

Undercover agents from the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Office managed to amass enough evidence to obtain a search warrant for the casino. On May 15, 2019, a team of deputies descended on the casino and arrested six individuals who were allegedly involved in the gambling ring. In addition to the two men who had initially been arrested, four others were taken into custody.

$100,000 in cash and several slot machines were seized during the raid. According to Sheriff Bill Brown, this was one of largest operations his department has ever shut down. "This is a significant blow to organized crime in our area," Brown said in a statement.

The six suspects were all booked into county jail on various charges including conspiracy and illegal gambling. They are all currently awaiting trial.
