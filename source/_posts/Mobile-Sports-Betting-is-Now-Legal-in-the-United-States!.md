#  Mobile Sports Betting is Now Legal in the United States!

Mobile sports betting is now allowed in all 50 US states! This change was made possible thanks to the Supreme Court ruling in May 2018 that struck down the federal law prohibiting most sports betting.

This ruling has already led to a number of states introducing or approving legislation that would allow for mobile sports betting. The list of states currently includes Delaware, New Jersey, Mississippi, West Virginia, and Rhode Island. It is expected that many more states will soon follow suit.

There are a number of reasons why mobile sports betting is such a big deal. Firstly, it allows people to place bets on sporting events from anywhere in the United States. This is a huge convenience for those who do not have access to a physical casino or race track.

Secondly, mobile sports betting offers much better odds than traditional bet placement methods such as through a bookmaker or at a casino. This is because the odds are set by the casinos themselves, and not by third-party bookmakers.

Finally, mobile sports betting offers players the opportunity to win large cash prizes. For instance, in December 2017 an anonymous punter won $1.19 million by betting on a single game of American football!

If you are interested in taking advantage of mobile sports betting, then be sure to check out one of the states that have already legalized it. You won’t regret it!

#  New Jersey Becomes First State to Offer Mobile Sports Betting

On Monday, New Jersey became the first state in the US to offer mobile sports betting. Governor Phil Murphy signed a bill into law that will allow people in the state to bet on sports using their phones.

Mobile sports betting is already available in other countries around the world, including the UK, but it has been slow to catch on in the US. This is largely due to a federal law that bans most forms of gambling nationwide. However, New Jersey was able to get around this law by legalizing sports betting in 2013.

Governor Murphy said that mobile sports betting will "create new economic opportunities for our casinos and racetracks, and generate new tax revenue for our state." He added that it will also help attract more tourists to New Jersey.

The new law allows people over the age of 21 to bet on football, basketball, baseball, hockey, soccer, and other sporting events. The state's gambling authority will be responsible for regulating and licensing mobile sports betting operators.

Some opponents of mobile sports betting argue that it could lead to addiction and other social problems. However, Governor Murphy believes that it can be "safely regulated and provide a valuable new option for consumers."

#  15 States Sue Federal Government Over Ban on Mobile Sports Betting

The governors of 15 US states have filed a lawsuit against the federal government in an attempt to overturn the ban on mobile sports betting.

The suit, which was spearheaded by Missouri Governor Eric Greitens, argues that the 1992 law which bans interstate sports betting is unconstitutional.

"This ban is unconstitutional and harms our states' economies," said Governor Greitens in a statement. "We are fighting for the rights of Missourians and all Americans who want to compete in the global economy."

The other 14 states involved in the suit are Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois,[카지노 사이트](https://choegocasino.com/) Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Ohio and Pennsylvania.

In anticipation of the lawsuit being filed, the American Gaming Association (AGA) released a report which estimates that mobile sports betting could generate up to $4.8 billion in annual revenue for US states.

"Today's filing makes it clear: The best way to protect consumers and support law enforcement is to repeal the federal ban on sports betting," said Geoff Freeman, president and CEO of the AGA. "We look forward to working with Congress and state legislatures across the country to enact common-sense policies that will create jobs and generate new revenues for states."

It remains to be seen whether or not this latest lawsuit will be successful in overturning the ban on mobile sports betting, but it's certainly another sign that momentum is growing behind efforts to legalize this activity nationwide.

#  Supreme Court Ruling Allows States to Regulate and Tax Mobile Sports Betting

On May 14, 2018, the United States Supreme Court issued a ruling in the case of Murphy v. National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) that allows states to regulate and tax mobile sports betting. The decision overturned a 1992 federal law, the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA), which had prohibited most states from legalizing sports betting.

The majority opinion, written by Justice Samuel Alito, argued that PASPA violated the Tenth Amendment of the US Constitution by infringing on state sovereignty. The Tenth Amendment reserves powers not delegated to the federal government to the states. Alito also rejected the argument that PASPA was necessary to protect the integrity of sports competitions, writing that “the legalization of sports gambling is a policy choice for Congress to make.”

In a dissenting opinion, Justice Stephen Breyer argued that PASPA was a “minor federal statute” that did not unduly burden state sovereignty. He also warned that repealing PASPA could lead to increased corruption in sports, as unregulated sports betting would be more susceptible to match-fixing and other forms of cheating.

The Murphy v. NCAA ruling is a significant victory for proponents of gambling reform, who have long argued that regulated sports betting would provide significant revenue opportunities for cash-strapped states. It remains to be seen how individual states will choose to regulate and tax mobile sports betting, but it is likely that there will be a strong push by state legislatures to get up and running quickly.

#  Delaware Begs for Federal Regulations Allowing for Mobile Sports Betting

A few weeks ago, Delaware lawmakers legalized mobile sports betting. This was seen as a major victory for the state, as it became the first to authorize such a move since the Supreme Court overturned PASPA in May.

Now, representatives from Delaware are asking the federal government to step in and provide some regulations that will allow them to offer this service legally.

“Delaware is ready to offer mobile sports betting but needs clarity on regulations from the federal government,” said state Sen. Brian Bushweller in a statement.

At the moment, it’s unclear what role – if any – the feds will play in this process. The Department of Justice has yet to issue any new rules or regulations pertaining to sports betting, and it’s possible that they may not do so anytime soon.

Even without specific guidelines from the feds, Delaware is still moving ahead with its plans to offer mobile sports betting. Officials say they are working with gaming operators to create a system that will be both convenient and compliant with state law.

John Payne, executive director of the Delaware Council on Gambling Problems, believes that mobile betting will be a valuable tool in combating problem gambling.

“We think this is going to be a great opportunity because we can monitor what people are doing on their phones and intervene much earlier than we ever could before,” he said.

Delaware is not alone in its quest for federal guidance on mobile sports betting. Several other states – including New Jersey, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania – are also waiting for clarification from Washington before launching their own programs.
