#  Precisely How to Import Data Into Stand Out Sports Betting Model - Kansas City Royals

This guide is all about how to import data into Stand Out, a sports betting model. If you are not sure how to use Stand Out or you are just starting out using it, this guide is perfect for you.

The first step is to make sure that your data is in the right format. The Stand Out sports betting model uses an Excel spreadsheet. The Excel spreadsheet must have four tabs: 
1) "Data" - This is where you will put all of your data including the match information and odds. 
2) "Sheet1" - This tab contains all of the formulas that will run the predictions. 
3) "Sheet2" - This tab will show you all of your predictions and how they did in relation to the actual results. 
4) "Sheet3" - This is a dummy sheet that you can use as a template for your own Excel spreadsheets.

The next step is to format your data correctly. Your Data tab should look something like this:

In order to properly format your data, please follow these steps: 
1) In column A, list the name of each team playing in the match. 
2) In column B, list the home team's odds (the odds given by the bookmaker). 
3) In column C, list the away team's odds (the odds given by the bookmaker). 
4) In column D, list the draw odds (the odds given by the bookmaker). 
5) In column E, list the match date. 
6) In column F, list the match time (in 24-hour time). 
7) In column G, list the match venue (e.g. Wembley Stadium). 
8) In column H, list whether this fixture is a home game or an away game for both teams (e.g. Home Team: Manchester City; Away Team: Liverpool).

Your Data tab should now look like this:

Now that your data is in the correct format, we can start importing it into Stand Out. Start by opening up Stand Out and clicking on "File" > "Import Data". A window will pop up and ask you where you want to import your data from. Select "Excel Spreadsheet" and then click on "Open". A second window will appear and ask you which Excel spreadsheet you would like to import. Select your "Data" tab and then click on "Open". Your Data tab should now be imported into Stand Out!

#  Master the Art of Sports Betting with Precisely how to Import Data into Stand out Model - Kansas City Royals

There are many different things you should do if you want to be a successful sports bettor. But one of the most important is learning how to import data into your Excel model. By doing this, you'll have all the information you need at your fingertips in order to make sound betting decisions. In this article, we'll show you precisely how to import data into Excel so that you can get started on your path to success.

First, launch Excel and create a new sheet. Then, go to File -> Import -> From Text. This will open up a window where you can specify the file you want to import. Select the file you downloaded earlier and click Open.

Excel will then ask you which column contains the header names. Select the first column (A) and click OK. Excel will then import all of the data from the file into your sheet.

Now, we're going to parse the data so that it's in a format that we can use for our model. To do this, we'll use some simple VBA code. Copy and paste the following code into your sheet:

Sub ParseData()


Dim row As Integer, col As Integer


For row = 2 To ActiveSheet.UsedRange.Rows.Count

For col = 1 To ActiveSheet.UsedRange.Columns.Count


If col <> 1 Then

	 Cells(row, col) = Cells(row, col) - 1



	End If

	Next col
	Next row

End Sub

This code will parse the data so that each row corresponds to a game, and each column corresponds to a statistic (e.g., home runs). Now we're ready to start building our model!

To begin, we'll create a table with the following headings: Date, Away Team, Home Team, Odds, Probability of Winning A Game (in percent), and Expected Value (in dollars). We'll also insert a column for our " Result" variable, which will tell us whether or not our bet won or lost. Here's how the table should look:


Date Away Team Home Team Odds Probability of Winning A Game Expected Value Result 1/1 Chicago White Sox Cleveland Indians -105 50% $-0.50 WIN 1/1 Los Angeles Dodgers San Diego Padres -165 28% $-4.62 LOSS 1/2 Boston Red Sox Toronto Blue Jays -133 57% $-0.93 WIN 1/2 Seattle Mariners Texas Rangers 110 43% $0.47 LOSS … … … … … … … … 12/31 Arizona Diamondbacks Colorado Rockies 100 50% $0...

#  Get Ahead of the Game by learning Precisely How to import data into a stand out sports betting model - Kansas City Royals

The preseason odds for the Kansas City Royals to win the World Series have been set at +2000 by <a href="http://www.bovada.lv/">Bovada</a>. That being said, why not take advantage of the opportunity and learn how to import data into a sports betting model? Once you have learned how to do so, you can use this information to your advantage by placing a wager on the Royals at their current odds.

In this article, you will be shown how to import data into a stand out sports betting model for the Kansas City Royals. This process is relatively simple and can be completed in a few short steps.

First and foremost, you will need to gather some data on the Royals. The data that you collect should include information such as the team's batting average, home runs, and RBIs over both the last season and the preseason. Once you have collected this data, it is time to begin importing it into your sports betting model.

To do so, you will first need to create a spreadsheet that includes all of the relevant data mentioned above. After creating the spreadsheet, you will then need to save it as a CSV file. From there, you can open up Excel and import the CSV file into your worksheet.

Once the CSV file has been imported, you will then need to format it in a way that is conducive to building a sports betting model. To do so, you will need to create two new columns: "Odds" and "Wins". The "Odds" column should list the odds for each game that are available at <a href="http://www.bovada.lv/">Bovada</a>, while the "Wins" column should list how many games were won by the Royals during each individual matchup (for example, if KC won 2-1 against Cleveland then put 2 in the "Wins" column for that matchup).

After formatting the data in this way, you can then begin constructing your sports betting model. To do so, simply multiply each game's corresponding odds by its corresponding number of wins (for example, if KC had +200 odds in a game and won that game then put 200 in cell D2). After completing this process for all of the games in your dataset, you will then have an accurate estimate of how much money you would have made if you had bet on KC for every game in which they were available at <a href="http://www.bovada.lv/">Bovada</a>.

While there is no guarantee that using this method will enable you to always pick winning bets on KC games, following these steps should give you a much better idea as to whether or not they are worth wagering on.
