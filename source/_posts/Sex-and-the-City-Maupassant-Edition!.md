#  Sex and the City: Maupassant Edition!

In the early 1800s, a woman's place was in the home. The only respectable career for a woman was to be a wife and mother. However, this began to change in the mid-1800s with the rise of the women's suffrage movement. Slowly but surely, women were gaining more and more rights. In 1892, French author Guy de Maupassant published a short story called "Boule de Suif". This story challenged the traditional view of women and broke new ground for feminist writers.

The story is set in northern France during the Franco-Prussian War. A group of refugees are stranded in a small town, and they are all starving to death. The only food that is available is from a local prostitute named Boule de Suif. She offers to share her food with the others, but they refuse to eat any of it because she is not respectable enough. Boule de Suif is humiliated by their rejection, and she decides to leave the town. However, the other refugees eventually realize that they need her help, so they beg her to come back.

"Boule de Suif" is an important feminist work because it challenges the traditional view of women as passive and obedient creatures. Maupassant portrays Boule de Suif as a strong and independent woman who is not afraid to stand up for herself. He also shows that women can be just as intelligent and capable as men. The story was very controversial when it was first published, but it helped to pave the way for future feminist writers like Virginia Woolf and Simone de Beauvoir.
