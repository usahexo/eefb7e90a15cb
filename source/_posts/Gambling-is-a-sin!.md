#  Gambling is a sin!

The Bible is clear on the sin of gambling. "But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart." (Matthew 5:28)

Gambling is all about greed and lust. You are trying to make money by taking advantage of someone else. The Bible also says, "For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil. Some people, eager for money, have wandered from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs." (1 Timothy 6:10)

Gambling can also lead to other sins such as stealing and cheating. It can ruin families and friendships. It's a trap that can ensnare you and keep you from God.

If you are struggling with gambling, please get help. There is hope and healing through Jesus Christ. He can set you free from the bondage of addiction. "Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has gone, the new has come!" (2 Corinthians 5:17)

#  Don't gamble, it's bad for your soul!

Gambling addiction is one of the most serious addictions out there. According to the National Council on Problem Gambling, about two million people in the United States are addicted to gambling. Gambling addiction can have serious consequences for both the gambler and their loved ones.

Problem gambling can lead to financial problems, job loss, family strife, and even suicide. Gambling addicts will often do anything to get money to gamble with, including borrowing money from friends and family, stealing, or cheating.

If you or someone you know is struggling with a gambling addiction, it's important to get help. There are many resources available for people struggling with gambling addiction, including counseling and support groups. Seek professional help if you need it.

If you don't have a gambling addiction, stay away from casinos and other gambling establishments. The consequences of problem gambling can be devastating, so it's best not to take the risk.

#  Gamblers are going to Hell!

Gambling is a sin! The Bible tells us so in 1 Corinthians 6:9-10. "Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived. Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor homosexuals, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners will inherit the kingdom of God."

That's pretty clear! So if you're a gambler, you're going to Hell! You might as well give your money to the church now and avoid eternal damnation.

Think about it – gambling is all about taking risks. You could win or lose everything you bet. That's a sure way to end up in Hell!

Some people might try to argue that gambling is just a bit of fun and that it's no big deal if you lose some money. But that's not what the Bible says. Gambling is a serious sin and it's wrong to do it.

So if you're a gambler, stop doing it right now! It's not worth risking your soul for the chance to win some money. Give your money to the church and ask for God's forgiveness. It's the only way to make sure you'll go to Heaven when you die.
