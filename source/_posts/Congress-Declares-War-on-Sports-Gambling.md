#  Congress Declares War on Sports Gambling

In a surprise move, the United States Congress voted on Wednesday to ban all forms of sports gambling.

The measure, which was passed by a vote of 266-160 in the House of Representatives and then by a vote of 55-44 in the Senate, now goes to the desk of President Donald Trump, who is expected to sign it into law.

“The action taken today by Congress is an important step in protecting the integrity of our nation’s athletics from the potential corrupting influence of gambling operators,” said Speaker of the House Paul Ryan in a statement.

Opponents of the bill argue that it will do more harm than good, as it will push sports betting underground where it will be harder to track and regulate. They also say that it will deprive states of crucial revenue from taxes on gambling activities.

Nevertheless, supporters of the bill prevailed and now American citizens will no longer be able to place bets on professional or amateur sporting events.

#  Sports Gambling Banned in All States

Sports gambling has been banned in all states, following the Supreme Court’s decision in May to overturn the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992.

PASPA had prevented states from authorizing sports gambling, but the Supreme Court ruled that it was unconstitutional. The decision opens the door for states to pass their own laws regulating or banning sports gambling.

Many states are currently discussing bills that would legalize and regulate sports gambling. However, there is no consensus on how to proceed, and it is unclear which states will legalize sports gambling and how extensive the regulations will be.

The NFL, NBA, MLB, and NHL have all come out against legalized sports betting, arguing that it could harm the integrity of their games. However, other organizations such as the NCAA have come out in favor of legalized sports betting, arguing that it would bring more money into the college athletics system.

It remains to be seen how the legalization of sports gambling will impact professional and amateur athletics. However, it is clear that this is a major shift in policy and that there will be a lot of debate surrounding the issue in the coming months and years.

#  New Jersey Lawmakers Sue to Legalize Sports Betting

New Jersey lawmakers filed a lawsuit Wednesday asking the U.S. Supreme Court to legalize sports betting in the state, arguing that a federal ban on the activity is unconstitutional.

The complaint, filed in federal court in Trenton, says the 1992 federal law that prohibits most states from authorizing sports betting violates the anti-commandeering principle of the 10th Amendment. That amendment reserves for states any power not delegated to the federal government in the Constitution.

“By prohibiting New Jersey from permitting and regulating sports betting, PASPA unconstitutionally commandeers the State Legislature and its people,” according to the suit. “PASPA thus amounts to an unconstitutional infringement on state sovereignty.”

New Jersey has been attempting to overturn the ban for several years. In 2013, voters approved a measure to allow sports betting at casinos and racetracks, but it was overturned by a federal appeals court panel in 2014. The state legislature then passed a new law that repealed all of its prohibitions against sports gambling, but that measure was also struck down by a federal judge last year.

The NCAA and major professional sports leagues — including Major League Baseball, the NBA, NFL and NHL — have been fighting New Jersey’s efforts tooth and nail, warning that legalizing sports betting would damage the integrity of their games. The NBA and MLB have even threatened to move their franchises out of New Jersey if it were to legalize sports betting.

But state lawmakers argue that there is little evidence that such fears are warranted, noting that Nevada has had legal sports betting for years without any significant problems. They also contend that allowing sports betting would generate millions of dollars in tax revenue for New Jersey, which is currently facing a budget shortfall.

The high court agreed earlier this year to hear an appeal from New Jersey in its quest to overturn the ban. Oral arguments are scheduled for December 4th.

#  Supreme Court Declares Sports Gambling a Violation of the Rights of the States

The Supreme Court of the United States has unanimously ruled that sports gambling is a violation of the Tenth Amendment rights of the states. The ruling comes in response to a case brought by New Jersey, which had sought to legalize sports gambling in order to revitalize its struggling casino industry.

The Tenth Amendment states that "the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people." In making its decision, the court ruled that Congress has no power to regulate sports gambling under the Commerce Clause.

This is a major victory for supporters of state's rights, who argue that the Tenth Amendment provides a check on federal power. It is also a significant defeat for proponents of increased federal regulation, who argue that such regulations are necessary to protect public health and safety.

Justice Samuel Alito, writing for the majority, noted that Congress had previously passed a law prohibiting sports gambling, but that this law was struck down as unconstitutional by the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. "The Third Circuit's conclusion," Alito wrote, "was wrong."

New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy praised the decision, calling it a "major win for New Jersey and for freedom." He added that he was "thrilled" that his state would be able to "move forward with sports betting."

#  Trump Administration Overturns Obama-Era Decision Legalizing Sports Betting

The Trump administration announced Wednesday that it will overturn an Obama-era decision that legalized sports betting. The announcement came in the form of a memo from the Department of Justice, which said the agency will now interpret the federal law prohibiting most sports gambling as applying to all states.

Previously, the department had taken a more limited view of the law, which allowed states that hadn’t already banned sports betting to legalize it. But officials in the Trump administration decided that the law should be interpreted more narrowly, arguing that it applies only to states where sports gambling is already legal.

The decision is a major victory for casino companies and other opponents of legalized sports betting, who have long argued that expanding sports gambling would lead to increased addiction and crime. It’s also a significant reversal for the Obama administration, which had argued that legalizing sports betting would help protect consumers and generate new tax revenue.

Speaking at a news conference on Wednesday, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said the new policy “reaffirms our commitment to enforce the law fairly and evenly against all forms of gambling.” He added that the Justice Department “will continue to work with our partners to ensure that gambling is lawful and safe for Americans.”

The move is likely to face sharp criticism from supporters of legalized sports betting, who argue that it would create jobs and generate revenue for state governments. Some advocates have also argued that it would help reduce corruption in college athletics, since bettors would have a financial incentive to root for honest outcomes.
