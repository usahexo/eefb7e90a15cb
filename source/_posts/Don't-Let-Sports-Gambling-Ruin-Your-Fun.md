#  Don't Let Sports Gambling Ruin Your Fun

The legalization of sports gambling has led to more people engaging in the hobby. While some people may enjoy spending hours watching games and analyzing matchups to try and gain an edge, others may view it as a way to make some quick and easy money. If you are new to sports gambling, here are a few tips to help you enjoy the experience without ruining your fun.

# Learn the Basics

Before you start betting on games, it is important to learn the basics. This includes understanding how point spreads work, how moneylines operate, and how over/under odds operate. These concepts can be a little confusing at first, but with a little practice you will get the hang of it.

# Start Small

Don't be tempted to bet large sums of money right away. Start small and gradually increase your bets as you become more comfortable with the process. This will help minimize your losses if things don't go your way.

# Avoid Gambling on Games You Don't Know About

It is always a bad idea to bet on games that you don't know much about. In order to make money gambling on sports, you need to have a strong understanding of the teams involved and the strategies that they employ. If you are not familiar with either of these things, it is best to stay away from betting on that particular game.

# Don't Get Emotionally Involved

One of the biggest mistakes that people make when gambling on sports is getting emotionally involved. When you start rooting for one team or another, it can cloud your judgment and lead to poor decision-making. Try to stay unbiased and focused on making logical decisions if you want to be successful in this endeavor.

#  NFL Owners Approve Sports Gambling For Teams In New Jersey 
On Thursday, NFL owners voted 31-1 in favor of allowing the Oakland Raiders to move to Las Vegas. The only team to vote against the move was the Miami Dolphins. In a separate vote, the NFL also approved allowing sports gambling on its games in New Jersey. This is a major victory for the state, which has been trying to legalize sports betting for years.

The NFL's decision to allow sports betting in New Jersey is a big win for the state, and it could have a major impact on the economy. According to an estimate from Eilers & Krejcik Gaming, legalizing sports betting in New Jersey could generate up to $265 million in annual gaming revenue. That would be a welcome boost for a state that has been struggling economically in recent years.

There are also some potential benefits for the NFL. By allowing sports betting in New Jersey, the league could be able to generate more revenue from television rights and sponsorships. It could also help attract new fans to the sport.

Of course, there are some potential risks as well. There is always the possibility that organized crime will try to influence the outcome of games or that fans will bet on games they have no interest in watching. However, these risks can be managed with strong regulation and enforcement.

Ultimately, the NFL's decision to allow sports betting in New Jersey is a smart move. It will help boost the state's economy and could also lead to more fans of the sport.

#  NBA Commissioner Adam Silver Believes Legalized Sports Gambling Will Benefit The NBA 

On Tuesday, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver doubled down on his belief that legalized sports gambling will be a massive financial boon for the league.

“My view is that it will be good for the sport,” Silver said of legalized sports gambling at the New York Economic Club. “It will ultimately be good for the league because it will add more transparency and nuance to our understanding of what is happening in games.”

This isn’t the first time Silver has voiced his support for legalized sports gambling; he first spoke in favor of it back in November 2014. At the time, Silver stated that he believed sports betting should be legal in states where casino gambling is already allowed.

 Silver reiterated his stance on Tuesday, arguing that legalizing sports betting would provide more information to bettors, which would make the game more exciting and decrease instances of match-fixing. He also believes that legalized sports gambling would create new opportunities for sponsorship and advertising deals.

While some leagues (including the NFL) remain opposed to legalized sports gambling, Silver’s strong stance may help persuade them to change their minds. In March, Major League Baseball wrote a letter to Congress urging them to reconsider legislation that would legalize sports betting nationwide.

#  Las Vegas Casino Fined For Allowing Sports Gambling On Premises 

The Nevada Gaming Commission has levied a $5,000 fine against the SLS Las Vegas casino for allowing unauthorized sports gambling on its premises. The commission found that SLS had allowed guests to place bets on sporting events inside the casino, in direct contradiction of state gaming regulations.

This is not the first time that the SLS Las Vegas has come into conflict with state gaming authorities. In October of last year, the casino was fined $10,000 for permitting unlicensed gaming activity in its rooms.

In a statement released following the latest ruling, Gaming Commission chairman Tony Alamo Jr. said: "It is incumbent upon all licensees to comply with all regulations, and we will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to enforce these regulations."

The SLS Las Vegas is one of several casinos in Nevada that have been caught up in recent years in a crackdown on illegal sports gambling by state authorities. In February of this year, the Wynn casino was fined $5,000 for similar violations. Other casinos that have been fined in recent years include the Bellagio, Caesar's Palace, and Treasure Island.

#  Connecticut AG Prohibits State Employees From Betting On College And Pro Sporting Events

Attorney General George Jepsen announced a ban on state employees from betting on college and professional sporting events, effective immediately.

The new policy prohibits state personnel from placing bets on any college or professional sport, either through bookmakers or with other individuals. The ban covers all state employees, including those working in the executive, legislative and judicial branches.

"We are instituting this policy to protect the integrity of our state government and to ensure that our employees are not placed in a position where they could be influenced by their personal financial interests," said Jepsen. "It is important that the public have confidence that the decisions of our government are not tainted by improper influence."

Jepsen said he was confident that the new policy would not impact the ability of state employees to lawfully participate in office pools for such events as the Super Bowl or March Madness.

"This policy is about placing bets, not making wagers on legitimate competitive activities," he said.
