#  Suns Use Dealer Strategy to Earn Third Straight Victory

The Phoenix Suns used a dealer strategy to earn their third consecutive victory. The Suns started the game aggressively, forcing the dealers to fold on several occasions. This allowed the Suns to build an early lead that they would not relinquish.

The Suns were led by Devin Booker, who scored 31 points on the night. He was ably supported by TJ Warren and Josh Jackson, who both scored in double figures.

The Suns will look to continue their winning streak when they take on the Golden State Warriors on Saturday night.

#  Suns trounce Lakers with expert dealer play

In their first matchup of the season, the Phoenix Suns came away with a decisive victory against the LeBron-less Lakers. Led by savvy veteran play and expert dealer moves from Devin Booker, TJ Warren and Mikal Bridges, the Suns were able to score 116 points on a strong 53% shooting performance.

Booker was especially impressive, scoring 28 points on 11-of-18 shooting while also contributing five rebounds and eight assists. The Suns’ other youngsters also played well, with Warren chipping in 22 points on 9-of-16 shooting and Bridges adding 14 points (on 5-of-7 shooting) and seven rebounds.

Rookie point guard Lonzo Ball was the only bright spot for the Lakers, scoring a game-high 29 points on an efficient 11-of-15 shooting night. However, he was sorely unsupported by his teammates, who combined to shoot just 36% from the field.

The win improves Phoenix’s record to 4-5 on the season as they continue to fight for a playoff spot in the tough Western Conference. With LeBron now out of Los Angeles, it looks like it may be the Suns’ year to make some noise in the playoffs.

#  Dealers gives Suns the win in blackjack matchup

Monday's game against the Charlotte Hornets may have looked like a routine win on paper, but the Suns had to work for it. The Hornets battered Phoenix on the boards, out-rebounding them 54-33. Devin Booker led the Suns with 24 points and TJ Warrenadded 23 off the bench, but it was not enough to overcome the deficit.

The difference in the game came down to turnovers and free throws. Phoenix turned the ball over 17 times, resulting in 27 points for Charlotte, while Charlotte only turned it over 9 times, resulting in 13 points for Phoenix. Additionally, Charlotte made 26 of their 31 free throws (83%), while Phoenix made just 15 of 24 (63%).

"We competed," said coach Jay Triano after the game. "I don't think we had great focus tonight and that resulted in a lot of turnovers. We've got to take care of the basketball."

Fortunately for the Suns, they will not have to worry about playing the Hornets again this season. They will now turn their attention to a four-game road trip that begins Wednesday night in Dallas.

#  Suns beat Clippers with help from the dealer

In a matchup of two of the top teams in the Western Conference, the Phoenix Suns came out on top, thanks in part to a lucky bounce from the dealer.

The Suns were trailing by two points with less than five seconds left on the clock when Devin Booker got the ball and drove to the basket. His shot was blocked by Clippers guard Patrick Beverley, but the ball bounced off the dealer and into the hoop, giving Phoenix the win.

“I thought my shot was going in, but then I saw it hit off the dealer and go in,” said Booker. “It was a lucky bounce, but we’ll take it.”

The victory improved Phoenix’s record to 29-21 and moved them into third place in the Western Conference standings. The Clippers fall to 31-20 and remain in second place.

#  Dealer strategy propels Suns to victory over Jazz

The Phoenix Suns (16-30) used a well-executed dealer strategy to top the Utah Jazz (23-23) 120-100 on Wednesday night.

"We just stuck to our game plan," said Suns forward TJ Warren. "We knew they were a tough defensive team, so we wanted to take our time and make the right plays."

Phoenix's dealer strategy consisted of patiently attacking the Jazz defense in the mid and low post. The Suns also made a concerted effort to get the ball into the hands of their playmakers, which resulted in 21 assists on 36 baskets.

"Our guys did a great job of moving the ball and finding the open man," said Suns head coach Jay Triano. "We're starting to gel as a team and it's showing in our results."

Leading the way for Phoenix was Devin Booker, who finished with 32 points on 10-of-19 shooting, including 4-of-9 from three-point range. Booker also pulled down eight rebounds and dished out six assists. Other contributors for the Suns include Warren (19 points), Josh Jackson (17 points) and Elfrid Payton (10 points).

On the other side, Rudy Gobert led Utah with 22 points and 14 rebounds, while Donovan Mitchell chipped in 18 points. Joe Ingles added 16 points off the bench for the Jazz.
